# Session Handoff — recruiter-assistant

Read this first if you're resuming cold. It captures state, environment quirks, and the exact next step. The full plan is [docs/EXTRACTION_PLAN.md](docs/EXTRACTION_PLAN.md) — this file is the orientation layer.

## What we're doing

Building a **local-first recruiter assistant**: evidence-backed resume ranking → shortlists, fully offline. We are **porting the resume-ranking feature out of `C:\repos\hris`** onto a golden template, stripping the review workflow and JD-Harmonizer, and replacing MinIO with filesystem storage. See the plan for the keep/cut boundary and the 4-stage ranking algorithm.

## Repos & locations

| Thing | Location |
|---|---|
| **This project** (the real thing) | `github.com/humanaxiom/recruiter-assistant` (private) — local `origin` points here |
| Working copy | `C:\repos\recruiter-assistant` — on `main` |
| **Golden template** (frozen, don't build here) | `github.com/adamsalah13/agent-harness-template` (private, is-template) |
| **Source to port FROM** | `C:\repos\hris` (Python 3.12 uv monorepo; the ranking feature lives in `packages/` + `apps/api` + `apps/worker`) |

The working copy currently holds the **template scaffolding** (chassis) plus the plan and subagents. Product code is **not started**.

## Current state

**Done:** repo created + `origin` repointed + pushed; 4 decisions locked; plan-of-record and the `data-pipeline` + `ranking-evals` subagents committed.

**Not started:** Phase 0 onward. The repo still contains the template's **demo app** at `core/src/agents/` (planner/coder/etc. as *product* code) — Phase 0+ replaces it with the ranking domain. Don't confuse it with `.claude/agents/` (the build subagents).

**Decisions locked:** template-first port · filesystem storage (MinIO dropped — community edition archived 2026-04-25) · keep Neo4j (load-bearing) · v1 includes cover-letter/motivation, reverse-match, a minimal Flask viewer, and blind-review redaction ON by default.

## Environment quirks (IMPORTANT — a fresh session won't know these)

- **No real Python on this host** — only the WindowsApps stub. You **cannot** run `make gates` natively. Verify the offline gate suite in a container:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -v "C:\repos\recruiter-assistant:/w" -w /w/core python:3.11-slim bash -lc \
    "pip install -q -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt && \
     ruff check --fix src tests && black src tests && \
     ruff check src tests && black --check src tests && mypy src --strict && \
     pytest tests/unit --cov=src --cov-fail-under=80 -q"
  ```
  (The `--fix` + `black` write pass auto-formats; the following `check`/`--check` then verify.)
- **Docker is available.** Integration/e2e that need live Postgres/Neo4j/Redis run via Docker/testcontainers (CI does `gates-all`).
- **Windows 11**, PowerShell primary; Bash tool available (Git Bash). `.claude/settings.json` hooks shell to `bash`, so Git Bash must be on PATH.
- **`gh` CLI** authed as `adamsalah13`, **admin on the `humanaxiom` org**. Pushing to `humanaxiom/recruiter-assistant` is authorized.
- Template Python is **3.11**; hris is **3.12**. Keep 3.11 (the template's) and port hris code to it — nothing in the ranking core needs 3.12.
- Model note: this is Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context); the latest models are the Claude 5 family / Opus 4.8 / Haiku 4.5.

## Subagent roster (`.claude/agents/`)

Build harness (from the template): `planner`, `tester`, `coder`, `reviewer`, `security`, `docs`.
Domain additions (this project): **`data-pipeline`** (ranking coder with the invariants baked in) and **`ranking-evals`** (merge-blocking quality gate: precision@k, evidence-verification rate = 1.0, PII-leak check).

Per-phase flow: planner → tester (+ evals fixture) → data-pipeline coder (ReviewLoop, ≤5 iters) → reviewer + security + ranking-evals (all merge-blocking) → docs. `make gates` green before the next phase.

## Non-negotiables (from CLAUDE.md)

Never commit to `main` for feature work (branch `agent|feat|fix|chore/<slug>`); TDD (failing tests first); offline only (no cloud endpoints — local Ollama/OpenAI-compatible client); config via settings; a single red gate = not done. Privacy: PII never enters embeddings; anonymization non-destructive; PIPEDA/FIPPA.

## Immediate next step — Phase 0 (seed & infra)

See the plan's "Current status & next step" for the checklist: rebrand the scaffold, adjust `docker-compose` (no MinIO, add `./data`), settings (768-d, storage dir), replace the template's SQLAlchemy `create_all` with **asyncpg idempotent DDL** for `jobs/resumes/shortlist_entries/outbox` + Neo4j bootstrap, remove the template demo app, land green.

hris source paths for every phase are in **Appendix A** of the plan.

## Trigger prompt (paste into a new session)

```
Resume the recruiter-assistant build. Working dir C:\repos\recruiter-assistant
(origin github.com/humanaxiom/recruiter-assistant). Read HANDOFF.md and
docs/EXTRACTION_PLAN.md first — they are the source of truth for state,
decisions, environment quirks, and the hris source-file map (Appendix A).

We are porting the resume-ranking feature from C:\repos\hris onto this template
(template-first, filesystem storage instead of MinIO, keep Neo4j, v1 includes
cover-letter/reverse-match/minimal viewer/blind-default). Planning is done;
product code is not started.

Start Phase 0 (seed & infra) via the TDD subagent loop, using the data-pipeline
and ranking-evals subagents. Note: no local Python — verify gates in the
python:3.11-slim Docker container per HANDOFF.md. Do Phase 0 on a feat/ branch,
land make gates green, then check in with me before Phase 1.
